  <h3>How much is the entry fee?</h3>
  <p>As of June 3, 2025, the entry fee is $15 (cash only) and must be paid at the time of registration. $10 goes directly into the pot, while $5 is an admin fee. Fees can change at the tournament director’s discretion, and any house adds will be announced at registration.</p>

  <h3>What is the admin fee?</h3>
  <p>The $5 admin fee covers the tournament director’s time, website maintenance and updates, Fargo fees to report tournament results, and other overhead costs needed to keep the tournament running smoothly.</p>
