  <!-- Tournament Overview -->
  <h3>🏆 Tournament Overview</h3>

  <h4>Who can play in these tournaments?</h4>
  <p>Any player with a Fargo rating of 445 and below is welcome! You'll need to show your Fargo account and a photo ID at registration.</p>

  <h4>Who is this tournament for, and why is the Fargo cap so low?</h4>
  <p>This tournament is designed to give lower-rated players a competitive and welcoming environment to play and improve. The Portland and Vancouver areas already offer many open and uncapped tournaments, so this event is specifically for those who often find themselves outmatched in higher-level competitions. It's time to give the underdogs their own spotlight!</p>
