  <!-- Tournament Overview -->
  <h3>🏆 Tournament Overview 🏆</h3>

  <h4>Who can play in these tournaments?</h4>
  <p>Any player with a Fargo rating of 445 and below is welcome! You'll need to show your Fargo account and a photo ID at registration.</p>

  <h4>Who is this tournament for, and why is the Fargo cap so low?</h4>
  <p>This tournament series is designed to give lower-rated players a competitive and welcoming environment to play and improve. The Portland and Vancouver areas already offer many open and uncapped tournaments (see below), so this event is specifically for those who often find themselves outmatched in higher-level competitions. It's time to give the underdogs their own spotlight!</p>

  <!-- Registration & Entry -->
  <h3>📝 Registration & Entry 📝</h3>

  <h4>Do I need to sign up ahead of time?</h4>
  <p>It’s recommended but not required! You can submit your Fargo or APA screenshot on the <a href="{{ '/signup/' | relative_url }}">Sign Up</a> page.  Your rating will be confirmed live in the Fargo app or assigned by the tournament director at registration before the tournament starts.</p>

  <h4>What if the bracket and/or waitlist on the home page is full?</h4>
  <p>Even if the bracket and waitlist are full online, the final player list won’t be determined until registration. Swing by River or <a href="sms:7607938319">text the tournament director</a> before 6:30pm on Thursdays to check for any last-minute spots. We start shooting at 7 PM sharp; while showing up does not guarantee a spot, players who show up in person will always get priority over anyone not present, even if they’re listed online.</p>

  <h4>What happens if I’m called to a table and not present?</h4>
  <p>If you're not at the table within 5 minutes of being called, your match may be forfeited at the tournament director’s discretion.</p>

  <h4>What if there are fewer than 8 players or a no-show at the start of the tournament?</h4>
  <p>If a confirmed player doesn't show up by the time matches are being assigned, or if there are fewer than 8 total players, a <a href="#what-is-a-bye"><strong>Bye</strong></a> may be entered into the bracket to ensure fair and timely play.</p>

  <h4>Do I have to have a Fargo account?</h4>
  <p>Yes. All players must have a Fargo account to participate in River tournaments, as we report every event to Fargo to ensure fair competition for lower-rated players.</p>

  <h4>How do I create a Fargo account?</h4>
  <p>If you’re a first-timer, you can create a Fargo account using the mobile app. Here are the official download links:</p>

  <h4>How much is the entry fee?</h4>
  <p>As of June 3, 2025, the entry fee is $15 (cash only) and must be paid at the time of registration. $10 goes directly into the pot, while $5 is an admin fee. Fees can change at the tournament director’s discretion, and any house donations will be announced at registration.</p>

  <h4>What is the admin fee?</h4>
  <p>The $5 admin fee covers the tournament director’s time, website maintenance and updates, Fargo fees to report tournament results, and other overhead costs needed to keep the tournament running smoothly.</p>

  <h4>Do I need to bring anything?</h4>
  <p>Just bring your photo ID, a screenshot of your Fargo or APA rating (if you have one), and your $15 entry fee. We’ll provide the rest!</p>

  <!-- Format & Rules -->
  <h3>📏 Format & Rules 📏</h3>

  <h4>What format are we playing (8, 9, 10-ball)?</h4>
  <p>We'll alternate 8 and 9 ball weekly (starting with 9-ball on June 5th).  We will also be doing Ladies Night once a month (TBA).</p>

  <h4>What’s the race format?</h4>
  <p>Race lengths vary by format, the number of players, and Fargo gaps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>8–12 players: race to 3 (8-ball), 4 (9-ball)</li>
    <li>13–16 players: race to 2 (8-ball), 3 (9-ball)</li>
    <li>75–124 Fargo gap: higher rated player races +1 game</li>
    <li>125+ Fargo gap: higher rated player races +2 games</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>What rules are we playing by?</h4>
  <p>We follow modified BCA rules. No jump cues. Mark your pocket in 8-ball. House/tournament director may apply reasonable rule modifications for time, fairness, or safety.</p>

  <h4>Are Magic Racks allowed?</h4>
  <p>Yes — if both players agree. If not, triangle rack is default. Rack style must be consistent across all games in a match.</p>

  <h4>What is a lag?</h4>
  <p>Each player shoots a ball from behind the headstring to rebound off the foot rail. Closest ball to the head rail wins the lag. If it's a tie, lag again or flip a coin.</p>

  <h4 id="what-is-a-bye">What is a Bye?</h4>
  <p>A <strong>Bye</strong> means a player automatically advances to the next round without having to play a match that round. It is used to balance the bracket when there's an uneven number of players or a no-show at the start of the tournament.</p>
