  <!-- Tournament Overview -->
  <h3>🏆 Tournament Overview 🏆</h3>

  <h4>Who can play in these tournaments?</h4>
  <p>Any player with a Fargo rating of 445 and below is welcome! You'll need to show your Fargo account and a photo ID at registration.</p>

  <h4>Who is this tournament for, and why is the Fargo cap so low?</h4>
  <p>This tournament series is designed to give lower-rated players a competitive and welcoming environment to play and improve. The Portland and Vancouver areas already offer many open and uncapped tournaments (see below), so this event is specifically for those who often find themselves outmatched in higher-level competitions. It's time to give the underdogs their own spotlight!</p>

  <!-- Registration & Entry -->
  <h3>📝 Registration & Entry 📝</h3>

  <h4>Do I need to sign up ahead of time?</h4>
  <p>It’s recommended but not required! You can submit your Fargo or APA screenshot on the <a href="{{ '/signup/' | relative_url }}">Sign Up</a> page.  Your rating will be confirmed live in the Fargo app or assigned by the tournament director at registration before the tournament starts. Final ratings and eligibility are confirmed by the tournament director at check-in.</p>

  <h4>How do player ratings work?</h4>
  <p>If you don’t have a Fargo account, your APA rating will be converted to a comparable FargoRate. If you have neither, you’ll be entered at the maximum eligible rating (445) and monitored for future eligibility. If you have more than one Fargo account, we’ll use the highest rating. Players over 445 are not eligible—please get your accounts merged beforehand. A screenshot may be submitted during signup, but your official rating will be verified in the Fargo app at registration. All River Tournaments are reported to FargoRate, and once processed, you'll be able to claim your official profile.</p>

  <h4>What if the bracket and/or waitlist on the home page is full?</h4>
  <p>Even if the bracket and waitlist are full online, the final player list won’t be determined until registration. Swing by River or <a href="sms:7607938319">text the tournament director</a> before 6:30pm on Thursdays to check for any last-minute spots. We start shooting at 7 PM sharp; while showing up does not guarantee a spot, players who show up in person will always get priority over anyone not present, even if they’re listed online.</p>

  <h4>What happens if I’m called to a table and not present?</h4>
  <p>If you're not at the table within 5 minutes of being called, your match may be forfeited at the tournament director’s discretion.</p>

  <h4>What if there are fewer than 8 players or a no-show at the start of the tournament?</h4>
  <p>If a confirmed player doesn't show up by the time matches are being assigned, or if there are fewer than 8 total players, a <a href="#what-is-a-bye"><strong>Bye</strong></a> may be entered into the bracket to ensure fair and timely play.</p>

  <h4>Do I have to have a Fargo account?</h4>
  <p>We report every event to Fargo to ensure fair competition for lower-rated players. If you do not have a FargoRate account yet, you will automatically have a profile created after the first River tournament you play in, once FargoRate processes the scores.</p>

  <h4>How do I create a Fargo account?</h4>
  <p>If you’re a first-timer, you can create a Fargo account using the mobile app. Here are the official download links:</p>

  <h4>How much is the entry fee?</h4>
  <p>As of June 3, 2025, the entry fee is $15 (cash only) and must be paid at the time of registration. $10 goes directly into the pot, while $5 is an admin fee. Fees can change at the tournament director’s discretion, and any house donations will be announced at registration. Your bracket spot is only confirmed after your rating is verified and your entry fee is paid.</p>

  <h4>What is the admin fee?</h4>
  <p>The $5 admin fee covers the tournament director’s time, website maintenance and updates, Fargo fees to report tournament results, and other overhead costs needed to keep the tournament running smoothly.</p>
