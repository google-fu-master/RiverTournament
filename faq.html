  <!-- Tournament Overview -->
  <h3>üèÜ Tournament Overview</h3>

  <h4>Who can play in these tournaments?</h4>
  <p>Any player with a Fargo rating of 445 and below is welcome! You'll need to show your Fargo account and a photo ID at registration.</p>

  <h4>Who is this tournament for, and why is the Fargo cap so low?</h4>
  <p>This tournament series is designed to give lower-rated players a competitive and welcoming environment to play and improve. The Portland and Vancouver areas already offer many open and uncapped tournaments (see below), so this event is specifically for those who often find themselves outmatched in higher-level competitions. It's time to give the underdogs their own spotlight!</p>

  <!-- Registration & Entry -->
  <h3>üìù Registration & Entry</h3>

  <h4>Do I need to sign up ahead of time?</h4>
  <p>It‚Äôs recommended but not required! You can submit your Fargo or APA screenshot on the <a href="{{ '/signup/' | relative_url }}">Sign Up</a> page.  Your rating will be confirmed live in the Fargo app or assigned by the tournament director at registration before the tournament starts.</p>

  <h4>What if the bracket and/or waitlist on the home page is full?</h4>
  <p>Even if the bracket and waitlist are full online, the final player list won‚Äôt be determined until registration. Swing by River or TEXT the tournament director <a href="sms:7607938319">760-793-8319</a> before 6:30pm on Thursdays to check for any last-minute spots. We start shooting at 7 PM sharp; while showing up does not guarantee a spot, players who show up in person will always get priority over anyone not present, even if they‚Äôre listed online.</p>

  <h4>Do I have to have a Fargo account?</h4>
  <p>Yes. All players must have a Fargo account to participate in River tournaments, as we report every event to Fargo to ensure fair competition for lower-rated players.</p>

  <h4>How do I create a Fargo account?</h4>
  <p>If you‚Äôre a first-timer, you can create a Fargo account using the mobile app. Here are the official download links:</p>
