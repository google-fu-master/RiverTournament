# Glassmorphism UI Experiment

This project is an experimental playground for building modern, accessible glassmorphic UI components (blurred glass effect) using Vite, vanilla JavaScript, and SCSS. The goal is to iterate on visually striking, modular components—such as navbars, buttons, and cards—over neon-themed Unsplash backgrounds, before applying them to production projects.

## Features
- **Glassmorphic Navbar & Buttons**: Modern, accessible, and visually bold.
- **Neon Unsplash Background**: Easily swappable for rapid design iteration.
- **SCSS Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend and experiment with new UI components.
- **Vite-Powered**: Fast development and hot module reload.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the landing page.

## File Structure
- `src/scss/` — Modular SCSS partials for variables, glassmorphism, navbar, and buttons.
- `index.html` — Landing page with glassmorphic components.
- `src/main.js` — JS entry point (ready for modular UI logic).

## Purpose
This repo is for rapid prototyping and visual experimentation. Feel free to fork, extend, and remix components for your own glassmorphism UI projects!
