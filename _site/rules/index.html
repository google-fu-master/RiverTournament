  <h2>Player Eligibility &amp; Registration</h2>
  <ul class="pool-ball-list">
    <li class="numbered-1">Players with Fargo ratings of 445 and below are welcome in our 8, 9, and 10-ball tournaments.</li>
    <li>You’ll need to show a Fargo account and a photo ID at registration.</li>
    <li>First-timers can create a Fargo account using the mobile app (links coming soon in the FAQ).</li>
    <li>If you have more than one Fargo account, we’ll use the highest rating. If it’s over 445, you won’t be eligible—please get your accounts merged ahead of time.</li>
    <li>A screenshot of your Fargo rating can be uploaded in the Sign Up sheet, but your rating will be confirmed live in the Fargo app at registration.</li>
    <li>Entry fees must be paid at time of registration.</li>
    <li>If a player has an APA rating but no Fargo rating, their Fargo rating for the tournament will be determined using a conversion formula.</li>
    <li>If a player has no APA rating and no Fargo rating, they will be entered into the tournament at the highest eligible rating (445) and their Fargo account and performance will be monitored for eligibility if they return to future tournaments.</li>
    <li>All ratings and conversion assignments are subject to review and final approval by the tournament director.</li>
    <li><strong>Your rating at registration on tournament night will decide eligibility and race lengths.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>You do not have a spot in the bracket until your fee is paid, your Fargo rating has been verified, and your match requirements are confirmed.</strong></li>

  <h2>Equipment &amp; Gameplay</h2>
  <ul class="pool-ball-list">

    <li>Players lag or flip a coin for the first break, then alternate breaks. If there’s no agreement, lagging is the default.</li>
    <li>Magic Racks are fine if both players agree; otherwise, triangle by default.</li>
    <li>Jump shots are not allowed at River, and performing jump shots may result in being banned from future River Tournaments.</li>
    <li>Timeouts are not allowed. If you’re unsure about a rule, refer to this page, or ask your opponent or another player not currently in a match. Bring all disagreements to the tournament director immediately.</li>
    <li>If you need a shot watched, ask anyone not currently playing in a match. If no one is available, ask the tournament director.</li>

<section id="conduct">
  <h2>Conduct &amp; House Rules</h2>
  <ul class="pool-ball-list">
    <li class="numbered-1">The tournament director reserves the right to refuse entry to any player, or to immediately remove any player from an ongoing tournament, for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to:
      <ul type="a">
        <li>Unsportsmanlike behavior of any kind at River or other pool tournaments in the Oregon community (APA, BCA, APL, etc.).</li>
        <li>Signs of substance impairment.</li>
        <li>Ineligible Fargo rating.</li>
        <li>Suspected or proven manipulation of Fargo ratings (sandbagging).</li>
        <li>Repeated intentional distraction of opponents (sharking).</li>
        <li>Verbal abuse or threats.</li>
        <li>Repeated failure to follow tournament rules or etiquette.</li>
        <li>Any behavior that jeopardizes the integrity of the River tournament or compromises River as a safe, fun, and inclusive space for low-level players.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>No drinks on or near pool tables. Spills or damage will result in permanent disqualification from the River tournament, and possibly from the establishment itself (as River management sees fit).</li>
    <li>House contributions to the pot aren’t guaranteed.</li>
    <li>Entry fees are cash only and may change.</li>
    <li><strong>The tournament director has the final say on all tournament matters.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Remember to tip your bartenders, staff, and tournament directors - they work hard for you!</strong></li>

  <ul>
    <li>Players lag or flip a coin for the first break. If there’s no agreement, lagging is the default. Breaks alternate after that.</li>
    <li>Racks: Players can use Magic Racks or Triangles, but it must be agreed upon by both players and used for the entire match. If players don’t agree, Triangle is the default.</li>
    <li>Fouls cannot occur before the rack is struck.</li>
    <li>8 on the break: If you make the 8-ball on the break, it’s an automatic win for that rack.</li>
    <li>Scratch on the break: Incoming player must shoot from behind the head string (“kitchen”).</li>
    <li>Open table after break until a called shot legally pockets a ball.</li>
    <li>Groups assigned by first legal shot after the break. If both are made on the break, table remains open.</li>
    <li>8-ball pocket must be marked (or called verbally if agreed upon before the match).</li>
    <li>8-ball scratch is loss of game.</li>
    <li>Other fouls: Ball-in-hand for the opponent anywhere on the table.</li>
    <li>You must hit your ball first and at least one ball (any group) or the cue ball must hit a rail. Otherwise it’s a foul.</li>
