  <h2 style="border-bottom: 2px solid #0071a4; padding-bottom: 0.5rem;">Player Eligibility &amp; Registration</h2>
  <ul style="line-height: 1.8; padding-left: 1rem;">
    <li class="numbered-1">Players with Fargo ratings of &lt;445 in 8-ball, &lt;430 in 9-Ball are welcome at River Tournaments (10-Ball TBD).</li>
    <li>Players must present a <strong>FargoRate or APA account</strong> (if you have one) and a <strong>photo ID</strong> at registration.</li>
	<li>If you <strong>do not have a FargoRate account</strong>, your <strong>APA rating will be converted</strong> to a comparable FargoRate for tournament eligibility.</li>
	<li>If you have <strong>no APA or Fargo rating</strong>, you will be entered at the <strong>maximum eligible rating (445 for 8-ball, 430 for 9-Ball)</strong> and monitored for future eligibility.</li>
	<li>If you have <strong>multiple Fargo accounts</strong>, the <strong>highest rating will be used</strong>. Players rated &gt;430 in 9-Ball and &gt;445 in 8-Ball are not eligible—please merge accounts beforehand.</li>
	<li>DigitalPool syncs with the FargoRate system. Your rating will be available to the tournament director immediately upon your registration (if you have one).  If you are in the OPAL APA system, the tournament director will find your profile and convert your rank. Please bring your APA app/account and have it ready at registration if you only have an APA rating and no Fargo.</li>
	<li>All River Tournaments are <strong>reported to FargoRate</strong>. Once processed, you will be able to <strong>claim your official profile</strong>.</li>
    <li>All ratings and conversion assignments are subject to review and final approval by the tournament director.</li>
    <li>Your rating at registration on tournament night will decide eligibility and race lengths.</li>
    <li>Entry fees must be paid at time of registration. Your spot will not be held without payment.</li>
    <li><strong>You do not have a spot in the bracket until your entry fee is paid, your Fargo rating has been verified/assigned, and your match requirements are confirmed.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Any confirmed player who does not show up by the time matches are being assigned may be forfeited and replaced with a <a href="#match-format">Bye</a>.</strong></li>

  <ul style="line-height: 1.8; padding-left: 1rem;">
    <li class="numbered-1">Race lengths vary by format, the number of players, and Fargo gaps:</li>
    <li><strong>8-Ball:</strong>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In all formats, if there’s a 75–124 Fargo point gap, the higher-rated player must win 1 extra game, and 2 extra games for 125+ Fargo point gap.</li>
    <li>We follow <a href="#bca-modified-rules">modified BCA rules</a>; adjustments may be made at the tournament director’s discretion <em>at any time</em> to encourage fair gameplay.</li>

    <li class="numbered-1">The tournament director reserves the right to refuse entry to any player, or to immediately remove any player from an ongoing tournament, for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to:
      <ul type="a">
        <li>Unsportsmanlike behavior of any kind at River or other pool tournaments in the Oregon community (APA, BCA, APL, etc.).</li>
        <li>Signs of substance impairment.</li>
        <li>Ineligible Fargo rating.</li>
        <li>Suspected or proven manipulation of Fargo ratings (sandbagging).</li>
        <li>Repeated intentional distraction of opponents (sharking).</li>
        <li>Verbal abuse or threats.</li>
        <li>Repeated failure to follow tournament rules or etiquette.</li>
        <li>Any behavior that jeopardizes the integrity of the River tournament or compromises River as a safe, fun, and inclusive space for low-level players.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>No drinks on or near pool tables. Spills or damage will result in permanent disqualification from the River tournament, and possibly from the establishment itself (as River management sees fit).</li>
    <li>House contributions to the pot aren’t guaranteed.</li>
    <li>Entry fees are cash only and may change.</li>
    <li><strong>The tournament director has the final say on all tournament matters.</strong></li>

      <li>9 on the snap: If the 9-ball is pocketed on the break, it’s an automatic win for that rack, except if it goes into the two foot-string pockets (the corner pockets closest to the rack). Then it’s spotted and play continues. The breaker continues shooting unless there was a foul.</li>
