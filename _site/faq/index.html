  <!-- Tournament Overview -->
  <h3>🏆 Tournament Overview</h3>

  <h4>Who can play in these tournaments?</h4>
  <p>Any player with a Fargo rating of 445 and below is welcome! You'll need to show your Fargo account and a photo ID at registration.</p>

  <h4>Who is this tournament for, and why is the Fargo cap so low?</h4>
  <p>This tournament is designed to give lower-rated players a competitive and welcoming environment to play and improve. The Portland and Vancouver areas already offer many open and uncapped tournaments, so this event is specifically for those who often find themselves outmatched in higher-level competitions. It's time to give the underdogs their own spotlight!</p>
  <ul>

  </ul>

  <!-- Registration & Entry -->
  <h3>📝 Registration & Entry</h3>

  <h4>Do I need to register ahead of time?</h4>
  <p>It’s recommended! You can submit your Fargo screenshot in the Sign Up sheet, but your rating will be confirmed live in the Fargo app at registration.</p>

  <h4>What if the bracket on the home page is full?</h4>
  <p>If the bracket is full, there’s usually a waitlist. Please show up or text <a href="tel:7607938319">760-793-8319</a> before 7pm to check for last-minute spots that might open up due to cancellations, no-shows, or last-minute ineligibility.</p>

  <h4>How do I create a Fargo account?</h4>
  <p>If you’re a first-timer, you can create a Fargo account using the mobile app. Here are the official download links:</p>

  </div>

  <h4>How much is the entry fee?</h4>
  <p>As of June 3, 2025, the entry fee is $15 (cash only) and must be paid at the time of registration. $10 goes directly into the pot, while $5 is an admin fee. Fees can change at the tournament director’s discretion, and any house adds will be announced at registration.</p>

  <h4>What is the admin fee?</h4>
  <p>The $5 admin fee covers the tournament director’s time, website maintenance and updates, Fargo fees to report tournament results, and other overhead costs needed to keep the tournament running smoothly.</p>

  <!-- Format & Rules -->
  <h3>📏 Format & Rules</h3>

  <h4>What’s the race format?</h4>
  <p>Race lengths vary by the number of players and Fargo gaps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>8–12 players: race to 3 wins</li>
    <li>13–16 players: race to 2 wins</li>
    <li>If there’s a 75+ Fargo gap, the higher-rated player must win 1 extra game</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Are there any rules I should know about?</h4>
  <p>We follow modified BCA rules, with adjustments made by the tournament director as needed. No jump shots are allowed, and players must mark their 8-ball pocket during 8-ball games.</p>

  <h4>Can I use my own rack?</h4>
  <p>Magic Racks are fine if both players agree. If not, triangle racks are the default.</p>

  <h4>Is there a house add to the pot?</h4>
  <p>House adds are not guaranteed, but if they’re offered for the night, they’ll be announced at registration.</p>
