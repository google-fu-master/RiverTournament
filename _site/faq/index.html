  <!-- Tournament Overview -->
  <h3>üèÜ Tournament Overview üèÜ</h3>

  <h4>Who can play in these tournaments?</h4>
  <p>Any player with a Fargo rating less than or equal to the rating caps is welcome! The current caps are 445 in 8-Ball, and 430 in 9-Ball. These caps are subject to change during the first few weeks as we find the right balance for fair competition. Thank you for your patience!</p>

  <h4>Who is this tournament for, and why is the Fargo cap so low?</h4>
  <p>This tournament series is designed to give lower-rated players a competitive and welcoming environment to play and improve. The Portland and Vancouver areas already offer many open and uncapped tournaments (see below), so this event is specifically for those who often find themselves outmatched in higher-level competitions. It's time to give the underdogs their own spotlight!</p>

  <!-- Registration & Entry -->
  <h3>üìù Registration & Entry üìù</h3>

  <h4>Do I need to sign up ahead of time?</h4>
  <p>It‚Äôs recommended but not required! You can sign up for the River Tournaments on DigitalPool (links below).  DigitalPool syncs with FargoRate - if you don't have a DigitalPool account or a FargotRate account, one will be created for you automatically as a result of playing in the River Tournaments; If you have an APA account, your ranks will be converted to a comparable FargoRate by the tournament director at registration for the purposes of the tournament.</p>
 <ul>
  <li><strong>8-Ball Tournaments:</strong> <a href="https://digitalpool.com/events/river-8-ball-series" target="_blank">https://digitalpool.com/events/river-8-ball-series</a></li>
  <li><strong>9-Ball Tournaments:</strong> <a href="https://digitalpool.com/events/river-9-ball-series" target="_blank">https://digitalpool.com/events/river-9-ball-series</a></li>
  <li><strong>Ladies Night 8-Ball Tournaments:</strong> <a href="https://digitalpool.com/events/river-thursday-ladies-night-8-ball-series" target="_blank">https://digitalpool.com/events/river-thursday-ladies-night-8-ball-series</a></li>
  <li><strong>Ladies Night 9-Ball Tournaments:</strong> <a href="https://digitalpool.com/events/river-thursday-ladies-night-9-ball-series" target="_blank">https://digitalpool.com/events/river-thursday-ladies-night-9-ball-series</a></li>
</ul>

  <h4>How do player ratings work?</h4>
  <p>If you don‚Äôt have a Fargo account, your APA rating will be converted to a comparable FargoRate. If you have neither, you‚Äôll be entered at the maximum eligible rating (430 in 9-Ball, 445 in 8-Ball) and your scores will be submitted to FargoRate to create a profile and rating for you. When you return to a River Tournament with a FargoRate profile, we will use your offical Fargo ranking. If you have more than one Fargo account, we‚Äôll use the highest rating. Players over 430 in 9-Ball and 445 in 8-Ball are not eligible‚Äîplease get your accounts merged beforehand. Your official rating will be verified in the Fargo app at registration or through DigitalPool. All River Tournaments are reported to FargoRate, and once processed, you'll be able to claim your official profile.</p>

  <h4>What if the bracket and/or waitlist on the home page is full?</h4>
  <p>Even if the bracket and waitlist are full online, the final player list won‚Äôt be determined until registration. Swing by River or <a href="sms:7607938319">text the tournament director</a> before 6:30pm on Thursdays to check for any last-minute spots. We start shooting at 7 PM sharp; while showing up does not guarantee a spot, players who show up in person will always get priority over anyone not present, even if they‚Äôre listed online.</p>

  <h4>What happens if I'm called to a table but I do not show up?</h4>
  <p>If you're not at the table within 5 minutes of being called, your match may be forfeited at the tournament director‚Äôs discretion.</p>

  <h4>What if there are fewer than 8 players or no-shows at the start of the tournament?</h4>
  <p>If a confirmed player doesn't show up by the time matches are being assigned, or if there are fewer than 8 total players, a <a href="#what-is-a-bye"><strong>Bye</strong></a> may be entered into the bracket to ensure fair and timely play.</p>

  <h4>How do I create a Fargo account?</h4>
  <p>You don‚Äôt need to create a Fargo account yourself. After you play in a FargoRate-reported event‚Äîlike any River Tournament‚ÄîFargo will automatically generate your profile. Scores are submitted weekly, and it may take a couple of weeks for your profile to appear. Once it's live, you can claim it in the FargoRate app and start tracking your progress:</p>
  <div style="display: flex; gap: 1rem; align-items: center; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
    <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fargorate/id1199102391" target="_blank">

    </a>
  </div>
  <p>Fargo profiles are automatically created when scores from an eligible match are submitted and processed by FargoRate. All River Tournaments are officially FargoRate reported. If you‚Äôre new and don‚Äôt already have a profile, one will be created for you automatically once your first event‚Äôs scores are processed.</p>
  <p>Fargo typically collects tournament data weekly, but processing and profile creation may take a few weeks. Once your profile is live, you‚Äôll be able to claim it through the app and begin tracking your rating and progress.</p>

  <h4>How much is the entry fee?</h4>
  <p>As of June 3, 2025, the entry fee is $15 (cash only) and must be paid at the time of registration. $10 goes directly into the pot, while $5 is an admin fee. Fees can change at the tournament director‚Äôs discretion, and any house donations will be announced at registration. Your bracket spot is only confirmed after your rating is verified and your entry fee is paid.</p>

  <h4>What is the admin fee?</h4>
  <p>The $5 admin fee covers the tournament director‚Äôs time, website maintenance and updates, Fargo fees to report tournament results, and other overhead costs needed to keep the tournament running smoothly.</p>
