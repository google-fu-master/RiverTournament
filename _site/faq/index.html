  <!-- Tournament Overview -->
  <h3>🏆 Tournament Overview</h3>

  <h4>Who can play in these tournaments?</h4>
  <p>Any player with a Fargo rating of 445 and below is welcome! You'll need to show your Fargo account and a photo ID at registration.</p>

  <h4>Who is this tournament for, and why is the Fargo cap so low?</h4>
  <p>This tournament is designed to give lower-rated players a competitive and welcoming environment to play and improve. The Portland and Vancouver areas already offer many open and uncapped tournaments, so this event is specifically for those who often find themselves outmatched in higher-level competitions. It's time to give the underdogs their own spotlight!</p>

  <!-- Registration & Entry -->
  <h3>📝 Registration & Entry</h3>

  <h4>Do I need to register ahead of time?</h4>
  <p>It’s recommended! You can submit your Fargo screenshot in the Sign Up sheet, but your rating will be confirmed live in the Fargo app at registration.</p>

  <h4>What if the bracket on the home page is full?</h4>
  <p>If the bracket is full, there’s usually a waitlist. Please show up or text <a href="tel:7607938319">760-793-8319</a> before 7pm to check for last-minute spots that might open up due to cancellations, no-shows, or last-minute ineligibility.</p>

  <p>The $5 admin fee covers the tournament director’s time, website maintenance and updates, Fargo fees to report tournament results, and other overhead costs needed to keep the tournament running smoothly.</p>

  <h3>📏 Format & Rules</h3>

  <h4>What’s the race format?</h4>
  <p>Race lengths vary by the number of players and Fargo gaps:</p>

    <li>13–16 players: race to 2 wins</li>
    <li>If there’s a 75+ Fargo gap, the higher-rated player must win 1 extra game</li>
