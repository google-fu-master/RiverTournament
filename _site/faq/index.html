  <!-- Tournament Overview -->
  <h3>üèÜ Tournament Overview</h3>

  <h4>Who can play in these tournaments?</h4>
  <p>Any player with a Fargo rating of 445 and below is welcome! You'll need to show your Fargo account and a photo ID at registration.</p>

  <h4>Who is this tournament for, and why is the Fargo cap so low?</h4>
  <p>This tournament series is designed to give lower-rated players a competitive and welcoming environment to play and improve. The Portland and Vancouver areas already offer many open and uncapped tournaments (see below), so this event is specifically for those who often find themselves outmatched in higher-level competitions. It's time to give the underdogs their own spotlight!</p>

    <li><a href="http://www.sharkshooter.net/Vancouver_Info.html" target="_blank">Vancouver Tournaments</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Note: The Shark Shooter website may show a "connection is not secure" error. You can safely continue past that warning to access tournament information.</em></p>

  <!-- Registration & Entry -->
  <h3>üìù Registration & Entry</h3>

  <h4>Do I need to sign up ahead of time?</h4>
  <p>It‚Äôs recommended but not required! You can submit your Fargo or APA screenshot on the <a href="/signup/">Sign Up</a> page.  Your rating will be confirmed live in the Fargo app or assigned by the tournament director at registration before the tournament starts.</p>

  <h4>What if the bracket and/or waitlist on the home page is full?</h4>
  <p>Even if the bracket and waitlist are full online, the final player list won‚Äôt be determined until registration. Swing by River or <a href="sms:7607938319">text the tournament director</a> before 6:30pm on Thursdays to check for any last-minute spots. We start shooting at 7 PM sharp; while showing up does not guarantee a spot, players who show up in person will always get priority over anyone not present, even if they‚Äôre listed online.</p>

  <h4>Do I have to have a Fargo account?</h4>
  <p>Yes. All players must have a Fargo account to participate in River tournaments, as we report every event to Fargo to ensure fair competition for lower-rated players.</p>

  <h4>How do I create a Fargo account?</h4>
  <p>If you‚Äôre a first-timer, you can create a Fargo account using the mobile app. Here are the official download links:</p>

  <h4>How much is the entry fee?</h4>
  <p>As of June 3, 2025, the entry fee is $15 (cash only) and must be paid at the time of registration. $10 goes directly into the pot, while $5 is an admin fee. Fees can change at the tournament director‚Äôs discretion, and any house donations will be announced at registration.</p>

  <h4>What is the admin fee?</h4>
  <p>The $5 admin fee covers the tournament director‚Äôs time, website maintenance and updates, Fargo fees to report tournament results, and other overhead costs needed to keep the tournament running smoothly.</p>

  <!-- Format & Rules -->
  <h3>üìè Format & Rules</h3>

  <h4>What format are we playing (8, 9, 10-ball)?</h4>
  <p>We'll alternate 8 and 9 ball weekly (starting with 9-ball on June 5th).  We will also be doing Ladies Night once a month (TBA).</p>

  <h4>What‚Äôs the race format?</h4>
  <p>Race lengths vary by format, the number of players, and Fargo gaps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>8-Ball:</li>
    <li>8‚Äì12 players: race to 3 wins</li>
    <li>13‚Äì16 players: race to 2 wins</li>
    <li>9-Ball:</li>
    <li>8‚Äì12 players: race to 4 wins</li>
    <li>13‚Äì16 players: race to 3 wins</li>
    <li>In all formats, if there‚Äôs a 75-124 Fargo point gap, the higher-rated player must win 1 extra game, and 2 extra games for 125+ Fargo point gap</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>What rules are we playing by?</h4>
  <p>We follow modified BCA rules, with adjustments made by the tournament director as needed. No jump shots are allowed, and players must mark their 8-ball pocket during 8-ball games.</p>

  <h4>Are Magic Racks allowed?</h4>
  <p>Magic Racks are allowed if both players agree. If not, triangle racks are the default. You must use the same style of rack for all games in that match. Both Magic Racks and triangles will be available at the tournament.</p>

  <h4>What is a lag?</h4>
  <p>A lag is when both players simultaneously shoot a ball from behind the head string (second diamond) to rebound off the opposite rail and come back as close as possible to the starting rail. The player whose ball stops closer to the starting rail (even if it bounces off the starting rail) wins the lag and may choose to break first or defer the break to their opponent. If both balls hit the same distance, lag again or flip a coin.</p>

  <!-- Venue & Logistics -->
  <h3>üìç Venue & Logistics</h3>

  <h4>Where is the tournament held?</h4>
  <p>We play at River Pool & Sports Bar, 19 NW 5th Ave, Downtown Portland. It‚Äôs easily accessible via MAX, and off-street paid parking is available. You can also check out the <a href="/location/">Location page</a> for venue and transit details.</p>

  <h4>What time is the tournament?</h4>
  <p>Registration starts at 6:30pm and shooting starts promptly at 7:00pm. Tables are always free at River; first come first serve for practice before the tournament.</p>

  <h4>Do you provide pool cues?</h4>
  <p>House cues are available at River if you don‚Äôt have your own. You‚Äôre also welcome to bring your personal cues. Jump shots are not allowed per house rules; break and playing cues are encouraged.</p>

  <h4>How many pool tables does River have?</h4>
  <p>River features three beautiful 7' Diamond tables for tournament play, and pool is always free ‚Äî 24/7/365!</p>

  <h4>Do I have to stay the whole night?</h4>
  <p>Matches run one after the other, so you‚Äôre welcome to watch, play, or hang out at the bar in between. But once your bracket‚Äôs done, you‚Äôre good to go!</p>

  <h4>Can I bring in outside food or drinks?</h4>
  <p>Outside food & drinks are not allowed, but River offers a delicious menu with a variety of food and drinks. You can check out the menu <a href="https://riverportland.com/menu/" target="_blank">here</a>. Don‚Äôt forget to tip your bartenders!</p>
