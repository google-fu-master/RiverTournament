This workspace is for experimenting with glassmorphism UI (blurred glass effect) using Vite, vanilla JS, and SCSS. Prioritize modern, accessible, and visually striking glassmorphic components (navbars, buttons, cards) over a neon/photographic Unsplash background. All code should be modular and easy to extend for further UI experiments.
